# A/B Testing with Bayesian Methods

This repository contains code for conducting AB tests using Bayesian methods. The goal of an AB test is to compare the performance of two versions of a website or product, with the goal of identifying which version is better at achieving a specific metric such as conversion rate, click-through rate, or engagement.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the process of conducting an AB test using the beta-binomial model, which is a common Bayesian model for comparing conversion rates. The notebooks cover the following topics:

* Specifying a prior distribution
* Updating the prior using the data
* Conducting Bayesian inference to compare the two versions

# Getting Started

To get started with the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip or conda.
